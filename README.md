## Welcome!
This GitHub repository will serve as the codebase for  the 2019-2020 school year.

## Getting Started
For now you can get started by following [this pdf](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-tutorial.pdf), and looking at the official [Skystone repository](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE).

Eventually there should be documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/CMS-FTC-Robotics/Robot-2019/wiki) for future reference.
